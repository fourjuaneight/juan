## Experience
#### Fron-End Developer, Freelance | Nov 2017 - Presnet
Over the past year, I’ve worked with a number of clients as an independent web developer creating and redesigning websites for marketing and documentation purposes. I've used modern web technologies like HTML, SASS, ES6, Hugo, and Git to create a wide range of sites. All with accessiblity, responsiveness, and speed in mind. Regardless of the client, I always strived to ensure my work was not only efficient but also accessible to any other developers that came after me.

#### Technician, Apple | Aug 2015 - Nov 2017
At the beginning of my career, I focused on creating promoters and establishing lasting relationships with customers. Through listening and understanding people’s concerns, I was able to provide personalized solutions to any need. Later on, I took on a different role where I primarily repaired relationships with existing customers. Whether it was a hardware or software issue, I triage customer issues and provide timely solutions.

#### Billingual Business Support, Comcast | Mar 2013 - Jun 2015
Coming from a diverse background, I understand everyone has different needs. And that is no different in regards to telecommunications. As a bilingual business support specialist, I helped many small and medium business acquire tailored solutions for their venture.
