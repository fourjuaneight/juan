I'm Juan and I make websites for a living. I've worked for the better part of a decade in IT until I decided to make things instead of rebooting them. For the entirety of my development career, I’ve worked freelance. Due to my lack of relevant experience when starting, I was unable to get a job. So, I made one for myself. The majority of my time has been spent working through UpWork where clients from all over the globe hire me to redesign or build their sites and applications. You can see an entire history of my work [there](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0193b7b6d6aeb0b86d). But now I’m moving towards working more independently.

I make websites that I would go to. That means they’re fast, accessible, intuitive and responsive. Although there are plenty of tools to make this happen, I prefer using static-site generators. Hugo and Jekyll are my favorites. They’re fast, modular and scalable. I write clean and light code, with other developers that’ll come after me in mind. I’ve done some work with Ruby on Rails redesigning web apps and creating new sites. I favor CSS for animations and transitions over JavaScript, semantic HTML, and modular code. And I can work with designers, developers, product managers, or consult on how a static-site can best suit your needs.

For those that prefer a list of skills:

* Hugo
* Jekyll
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Git
