I’ve been reading other developers workflow as of late. Mainly because my current setup has taken a turn for the worst and I’m reconsidering how I work altogether. The latter being the key point in all of this. Although my MacBook hasn’t been cooperating with me for some time now, I believe my problem lies in my point of view.

While searching for alternative setups, mainly around using an iPad, something seemed to stand out which was not about the tools themselves. Many developers which switched to using an iPad downgraded in a way their tools. But although what they were using had far less functionality than before, they were working as efficiently, if not more.

So that got me thinking and I started dismantling the way I currently work and how those that made the change were working. The biggest thing to stand out was the tendency to “multitask” while using a computer. What I mean by that is, when I turn on my Mac, my unconscious action is to open up a slew of apps that I think I need to have open at all times.

So now I have email, Slack, VS Code, Chrome and some 4-6 websites open. I’m working so, of course, I need to have everything at my fingertips. But do I really, though?

It would seem that by having the ability to simultaneously run multiple things at once a need to do so arises. Which only leads to less productivity. Multitasking is proven to be detrimental to productivity as there is no such thing as multitasking. An in a world with a constantly updating feed, we’re conditioned to feel that need to have everything a few taps away.

## Single Focus Environment
So clearly there’s an obvious problem there that needs to be addressed. An overhaul of my toolset isn’t needed to fix this, but a restructured mindset is. And that’s exactly what I did. Rather than having multiple windows open, I now have a single app at a time in fullscreen. I just switch between workspaces with a simple four finger swipe. Now my eyes are only focusing on the task at hand.

So what about team communication? Slack is the de facto place where this happens, but as many already know, this has only worsened communication. While this could be a blog post on its own, I’d like to point out something different rather than add to the already overabundance of rants.

Why not treat Slack like everyday communication? I’ve had a similar conversation with my partner. There are no unspoken rules that dictate we should all immediately reply to messages. In any case, these apps should eliminate the social guilt of replying at a later time. Hell, this is precisely why I practically ignore phone calls and just text everyone. 

Sure, while at work there’s always a sense of urgency. And there are exceptions to when you need to actively engage in a conversation. But for the most part, an occasional check-up can suffice. Something that simple can eliminate a tremendous about of anxiety while working.

## The Results
I’ve already implemented these changes to my workflow and I’ve noticed some positive changes; mainly a difference in efficiency. While only having one app taking my full attention, I also limit myself to only pull-up additional tools when needed. Rather than having Stackoverflow or Dash open at all times, I reach for them when I know I’ll need them.

A big part of this is self-discipline. Which I know most of us lack. But there are a plethora of tools that focus on, well, helping you focus. So rather than using these to force me into focusing, I’ve opted to use them to *train* me on focusing. And after a month or so I’m now able to do this without the need for said tools.

## What was the main point, again?
There’s always a new shiny tool that provides a solution to a problem we didn’t know we needed. But if we didn’t know we had that problem, do we really need it? This realization has fundamentally changed how I view my toolset. So if all I gain from using something like VS Code is a nicer interface, there’s no need for the exclusivity. This means I can easily work from any device that provides me the right tools and accommodates to my workflow.

If I were to change with what I work, a change in how I work was needed first. My research led me to this unintended realization. Every day I grow as a developer and learn something new. This is one of those days and I feel great.
