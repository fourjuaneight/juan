Jazz hustles. There are hundreds of ways she could have died on the Moon, a lot of which had nothing to do with the fact that's she lives on the Moon. But she worked hard and made a living creating opportunities for herself. There we countless times where it would've been completely ok to just sit and complain. She often did. But she also quickly started to contrive ways to solve her problems. I am all about that. I know this is not The Martian. It says Artemis on the cover. And the story did seem to depend a lot more on the hard science to wow the listener. But I have nothing but respect for Jazz.
