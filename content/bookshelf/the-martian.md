Mark Watney was fucked through most of the story. And he was well aware of his imminent doom. Yet, his mindset was that of an engineer. There's a problem. Ok, assess the situation, find the right tools and test a solution. Didn't work? Learn from your previous mistakes and try again. I am a problem solver to a fault. And hearing Mark constantly tackle everything that was thrown at him was sort of inspiring, and fun. This is hard science sci-fi and makes the story feel all the more real. It's human nature to survive at all costs. Mark does this with a great personality.
