This was my first John Green book. Which is surprising considering how much of his (and Hanks) content I already consume. And although I don't know him personally, I feel I've gotten to understand John very well from his many vlogs and podcast episodes. I know of his struggles with mental health. He once said he experiences {{< link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNEUz9v5RYo" content="\"obsessive thought spirals in which intrusive thoughts [...] sorta hijack [his] consciousness\"" >}}. And although I don't have any mental health issues, aside from the normal stuff that comes with being an adult in 2018, I can definitely relate to intrusive thoughts. And it's incredibly hard to explain what it feels like to be overpowered by an idea that refuses to leave your head. But here, John managed to perfectly describe what this feels like through Aza. I recounted many instances where I laid awake all night with the deafening sound of my thoughts keeping me awake while hearing Aza have her internal monologues [arguments]. I felt intimately connected with here in a way I've never done before with a character.
