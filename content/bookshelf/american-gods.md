The reason I decided to listen to this book was that of a single Goodreads review in which the reader explained how this book helped them overcome their religious breakup. Indirectly related to them and thought I’d give it a try. I loved American Gods. Not because it changed my worldview, but because of stories. And of course, all books are stories. But I’ve always had a fascination with peoples journey and struggles. Listening to the Old Gods talk about how their few believers carried them over to the new world reminded me of a Sunday evening at my grandparents listening to their stories about how their world was vastly different than mine and how that shaped who they are now.

I do have my thoughts about shadow and his almost *conformity* with everything happening around him. But, nevertheless, this was a great listen. Not in the "religious guilt shattering" way (to me at least) but in the "I want more of this" way.
